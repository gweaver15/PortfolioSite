# Portfolio Site 👋


A simple website to show off my projects and front-end skills as well as help people reach out to me. Hosted on Vercel but I'v experimented with deploying on AWS/Azure.

Currently just raw HTMl/CSS/JS, considering migrating to a front-end framework like Angular or React

Feel free to reach out with any suggestions or feedback!
